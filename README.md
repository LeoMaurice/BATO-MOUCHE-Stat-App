# BATO-MOUCHE/Composition of big cities

Project on analysing OSM data.
Progress :
- [ ] Datascrapping
- [ ] First analys
## Data scrapping

There are two ways to get OSM data :
- using Geofabrick : download and zip already .shp formats : great to use with geopands
    - See the near_eiffel_tower notebook
    - default : only a selection of towns/regions/countries : enough at least to starts with
    - advantage : files come in OSM data but also in .shp files : easier to open in geopandas

- using OSM datafiles (.osm = op-to-data, .osh = history) with osmium python library. .osm.pbf = contains every OSM elements versions through time.
     - see the example-code folder
     - main default : not easy extraction for more complicated shapes than a poi ?

The OSM files can be dowload through different ways :
- through the [API](https://www.openstreetmap.org/export) : limited, for instance we can't download the whole Paris (seems logical)
- through API overpass : mirror data from OSM
- through Planet OSM : regular copies
- through [Geofabrik](https://www.geofabrik.de) : regular copies but only a selection of towns/regions/countries. (Geofabrik already suppress user data but the rest of the metadata are the same)
